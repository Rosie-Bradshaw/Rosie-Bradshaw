I am a full-stack web developer with solid experience in Marketing and Business Operations. Fully understanding both company and customer needs has given me a clear advantage when developing intuitive yet result-oriented user experiences.

I am looking for a junior position in a dynamic, purposeful and diligent team, who never shy away from a challenge, to continue to improve my skills while building meaningful projects.
